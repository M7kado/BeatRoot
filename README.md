# ðŸ¥•BeatRootðŸŒ±

BeatRoot is a rhytm based gardening game with a twist ! Made in 48h during [GGJ 2023](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites/c-19) at ENSIEE's C-19.

You play as a farmer going back to their family's farm, only to be welcomed by an empty farm and a large beetroot order. 
Grow enough beetroots along the beat to go to the next level and unlock new tools !

Controls : ZQSD to move, K/L to swap to previous/next tool, Escape or Space to Pause/Unpause (B to skip a level)
